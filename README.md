# ASCIIart-websocket-code-challenge
Web application (frontend + backend) that allows users to upload a text file containing ASCII art image and input an interval in milliseconds

When the user hits “Print”, the file gets uploaded to the server. Then, the frontend should listen on a WebSocket for data. The backend pushes the uploaded file, line by line, via WebSocket, with a timeout between each line, as selected by the interval. The frontend should also show the percentage of the printed image.
